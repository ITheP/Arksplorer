# Welcome to Arksplorer

## What is Arksplorer?

Arksplorer is an Ark: Survival Evolved Dino finding utility, that also throws a lot more into the mix.

It only works with online servers, and the administrator of a server must set the server up to work with Arksplorer. This is because Arksplorer needs to be fed data
from the server that tells it where all those lovely dinos etc. are!

## What can it see?

It can see data about Wild Dinos, Tame Dinos and Suvivors. It will show you on a map where certain dinos are, and let you search for other dinos of the same type. You can also
check out all the dino's stats, including HP, Melee, Stamina etc. - and even colours! So yes, you can search for your perfect green and red T-Rex and Arksplorer will show you
exactly where to find it! Loose a dino somewhere? Maybe you can find it now :)

Arksplorer also embeds/links through to [Ark Wiki](https://ark.fandom.com) on Fandom, [Dododex](https://www.dododex.com/) and [Arkbuddy](https://www.tristan.games/apps/arkbuddy/) web sites, so you can quickly find more information about the dino's you are looking at, or look up other Ark
related information without having to open other web browsers.

There is even an alarm system in there! Imprinting on dinos and need to go feed them every 12 minutes? Not a problem - it can remind you! Gatchas popping out crystals and
you need to go check every 14 minutes before they dissapear? Not a problem!

## Sounds great, what are the limitations?

Unfortunatly the data in Arksplorer is only as up to date as the server it gets its data from. For the server this was developed against, it updates the data every 50ish minutes.
This is usually good enough for our purposes. How often it updates for you will be up to your server's admin. It does take server resource to do so don't expect them to
be updating their data every 10 seconds :)
