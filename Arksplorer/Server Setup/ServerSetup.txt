Arksplorer works on data generated by ARKViewer and hosted on a web site.

You can find more information about Arksplorer at https://github.com/miragedmuk/ARKViewer-Master

ARKViewer can generate data that shows things like the location of all wild/tame dinos, and chuck it onto a web site as json data for browsing.
Arksplorer just uses this data to feed into its interface.

Setting up ARKViewer is beyond the scope of this document, please refer to any help etc. related to it directly to set it up.

Arksplorer requires a few things to operate properly.

1. ArkViewer

ARKViewer must be set up to generate various json files
On the WiredCat server this includes...
   Wild.json      <-- where all wild dinos are
   Dinos.json     <-- where all tame dinos are
   Survivors.json <-- where all survivors are
   Timestamp.json <-- this is a special extra .json file generated that just has a timestamp when the data was last refreshed
These are generated on a per-map basis.

There should be a structure as follows...
...your.web.site/.../<mapname>/<jsonfile>.json

e.g.
http://wiredcat.hopto.org/WiredcatRagnarok/Wild.json
http://wiredcat.hopto.org/WiredcatRagnarok/Dinos.json
http://wiredcat.hopto.org/WiredcatRagnarok/Survivors.json
http://wiredcat.hopto.org/WiredcatRagnarok/timestamp.json
etc. for ragnarock, and a different subfolder for each other map

2. Hosting the data

You need to host a file ArksplorerData.json on the web site.
This file is used by Arksplorer when it starts up to load in a bit of information about your server along with what your websites URL's are (see point 1 above) for the various peices of data hosted there.
This means that end users don't have to worry about configurations, and you can change as you want.

An example ArksplorerData.json is included in the same folder as this file.

3. Letting the client know about your server

Give us at Arksplorer a shout where your web sites URL ArksplorerData.json is so we can add it to the clients predefined list of servers.
We just need 3 bits of information...

{
    "Name": "WiredCat",
    "Website": "http://wiredcat.hopto.org/",
     "Url": "http://wiredcat.hopto.org/ArksplorerData.json"
}

The name of your ark server
Your public facing web site (so users can find you easily if they want to go looking)
And the Url to the ArksplorerData.json

Then when users start Arksplorer you will be part of the drop down list of sites they can select from...
Arksplorer will go get the config file from your server
Then it knows where to read in the data itself.

Magic!

Alternatively, you can simply publish this information yourself.
Define a .json file containing the information listed above, and give to your players to copy into their .../Arksplorer/Servers folder.
Arskplorer will scan this folder and pick up any .json server definition files and add them into the interface.
There is are example `YourServer.json` and `YourServers.json` files here you can look at, for both a single server and multi server set up.
You can specify as many servers as you want in a multi-server variant - it is just a list of server information.
